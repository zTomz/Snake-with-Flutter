# Snake

I created this project to test my Flutter skills and I can recommend it to everyone. It makes fun and is not to difficult to write if you know a little bit about Flutter. I am coding with Flutter for the last 4 months or so and only developed apps. This is simply something else.

I think the code is today not so good. But I want to imrove it in the future.

Here a screenshot:
